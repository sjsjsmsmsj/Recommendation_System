- Github to solve real problems: 

First of all 
- Open terminal,  clone your local: git clone https://github.com/sjsjsmsmsj/Recommendation_System.git

- Rule for git: 

- Thịnh will assign task for everyone, to handle it 
- Every 2 weeks for 1 sprint 
- Thịnh will review code and merge it into (main/master)
- If you don't understand any task, please call me

- I will create a branch for each sprint
- This branch named sprint_number   
- You have to checkout for that branch : git checkout sprint_number (number: 1, 2 , 3 , ....)
- After you have wrote codes, you have to flow this: 
    git add (some files changes )         [for an example: git add README.md]
    git commit -m "fix|feature some content to solve task"
    git push 
    
    how to create a pull request:
        open github
        it will show: create a pull request, you only click and create it
        assign: sjsjsmsmsj
        labels: ready for review| ready for merge

- When you have different problem, please take note in this. Thank you for contribute
