- Github to solve real problems: 

First of all 
### Open terminal,  clone your local: git clone https://github.com/sjsjsmsmsj/Recommendation_System.git

### Rule for git: 

- Thịnh will assign task for everyone, to handle it 
- Every 2 weeks for 1 sprint 
- Thịnh will review code and merge it into (main/master)
- If you don't understand any task, please call me

### I will create a branch for each sprint

- I create 2 weeks for a branch: wk.. (for an example: wk1, wk2, ...)
    
    

### When do with a task, you have to convert wk.. to feature 
- checkout to a branch: git checkout wk..     
- update new codes: git pull
- create a branch: git checkout -b feature_name
- view the current branch: git branch
- write codes
-   see some files changes: git status
-   git add (some files changes )         [for an example: git add README.md]
-   git commit -m "fix|feature some content to solve task"
-   git push    (for the first time, you have to copy git push ...   in your terminal)

Open this project
-  Create a pull request:
        open github
        it will show: create a pull request, you only click and create it
        assign: sjsjsmsmsj
        labels: ready for review| ready for merge

- I will review and merge it.


- When you have different problem, please take note in this. Thank you for contribute
